# Game Design Project Synopsis

These projects were created as a team of several students in an effort to complete game design challenges. Each project was created within the span of a 2 week development and turn-around time. From concept, to design, to implementation. Each challenge had its own criteria and these are our final products. In addition a Post-Mortem presentation will be proovided to discuss the final design process of each game.
